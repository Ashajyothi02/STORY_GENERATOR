# Hackathon 2021 - Random Story Generator

## Project Overview
This project is designed to generate a random story every time the user runs the program. By storing different parts of the story in separate lists (e.g., characters, settings, actions), and using Python's `random` module, a new story is created dynamically. Users can input their name, and the story will include their name to create a personalized experience.

## Features
- **Random Story Generation**: Every execution results in a unique, random story.
- **Personalized Output**: The story includes the user's name based on input.
- **User Interaction**: After each story, the user is prompted if they would like to hear another one.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for story generation.
- **Google Colab**: Used for running and testing the program.
- **HTML (Optional)**: Can be used to create a front-end interface.
- **Random Module**: To randomly select story components from predefined lists.

## Process
1. Story parts such as characters, settings, and actions are stored in lists.
2. The user inputs their name and is asked if they want another story.
3. The program uses Python's random module to select different parts of the story from the lists.
4. A complete story is generated and displayed with the user's name.
5. The user can choose to generate another story or exit.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Ashajyothi02/STORY_GENERATOR.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd random-story-generator
   
3. Run the Python script using Google Colab or locally:
   python random_story_generator.py
   
4. Sample Output
   Once upon a time, John traveled to a mystical forest and encountered a wise old owl. They embarked on an exciting adventure.
